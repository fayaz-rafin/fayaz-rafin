## Experience:
### Prompt Engineer & AI Trainer
*Outlier â€“ (May,2024 - August,2024)*

At Outlier, I worked as a remote AI Trainer, specializing in prompt engineering to improve generative AI models for solving complex math equations with Wolfram integration. My role involved designing and refining prompts to optimize model accuracy, selecting the best responses, and ensuring consistent results. Using Python and MATLAB, I verified the AIâ€™s answers, making adjustments to achieve precise solutions. This experience sharpened my intuition for prompt-based optimization and deepened my understanding of AI model behavior, enabling me to contribute meaningfully to Outlier's mission of delivering reliable AI solutions.

### Software Engineer Intern
*Radar â€“ (May,2022 - August,2022)*

At Radar, I contributed to the development of a social matching app as a frontend developer using Flutter, with PostgreSQL and Go for backend support. I designed core features such as match, un-match, block, and unblock, enhancing user interaction and overall app functionality during its beta phase. I also made graphical improvements to the appâ€™s GUI and managed user data, implementing SQL queries to track user connections. Additionally, I leveraged Docker to streamline development processes. This role helped me refine my skills in app functionality design, database management, and backend integration.
