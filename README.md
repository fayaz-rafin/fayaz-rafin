## Experience:
### Software Engineer Intern
*Radar â€“ (May,2022 - August,2022)*

At Radar, a software company that created an app for matching people with similar interests, I worked on the frontend component of the app. I worked mainly using Flutter for the Frontend and I used PostgreSQL and GO for the backend component. I also designed the match, un-match, block and unblock features while the app was in beta and made slight graphical improvements to the app GUI.

### President
*Computing Students Hub â€“ (May,2022 - Present)*

As President, I lead a team of executives to organize events and initiatives that fostered community and professional development among members who have a passion in the field of computer science. I also got the opportunity to collaborate with industry professionals and academia to bring innovative speakers and hosted workshops about Machine Learning, React.js, Git, Bash, Leetcode, Discord-Bots and Figma.
